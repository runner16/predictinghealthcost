# Data Science Project: Predicting Medical Costs

The goal for this project was to predict medical cost based on the datasets provided to me. The following datasets were used:

-train_better_health.csv - This dataset contains demographic, activity-based, and condition data for ~57k members (patients). It is also includes a field called Medical_Cost which is used as the target variable in the model.
-train_clicks.csv - This dataset contains visit counts for every landing page that a member (patient) has visited.
-test_better_health.csv - This dataset mirrors the train_better_health data; however, it does not include Medical_Cost.
-test_clicks.csv - Similar to the test_better_health data, this data mirrors the train_clicks dataset and can be coupled with test_better_health for generating predictions on Medical_Cost.
-final_predictions.csv - My final predictions for predicting medical cost.
-Data Science - Medical Cost Projects.ipynb = shows the full Jupyter notebook.
